# privateTaxiService

This was a group project that was done that helps individuals book rides. An application that works similarly to Uber or Grab. There are two ends of users in this application, which are the customers and the staff. 

_User_
Like most applications, the application would require and registration for an account. Users can get enquiry of trips based on the cost as well as be shown the types of services provided by the company. Customers are notified after they have successfully made a booking and will be given a status on the driver (ie. platenumber, car brand, etc). Once the journey is complete the customer will be given a receipt once the journey has been completed. Once a journey has been completed, they may give a review on the driver. Customers can also cancel bookings that have been made but have not yet been completed. Payment type can be chosen as well as being able to apply promo codes.

_Staff_
The staff is allowed to help customers who do booking trough phone call to register for an account. They can also register drivers who are interested in joining the company. The company can also view customers account on bookings that have been made.
